Offer members-only events using popular events plugins and Paid Memberships Pro.

== Description ==
This Add On offers integration for popular events plugins, including:

* [Sugar Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sugar-calendar-lite/)
* [All-in-One Event Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/)

Events that are restricted by membership level will not allow non-members to view full event details or complete event registration. The list and single view of the event will show limited event details as defined by your Advanced Settings > "Show Excerpts to Non-Members" setting.
